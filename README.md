## Features

[//]: # "Add the features of your project here:"

-   ðŸ’¹ **Node Js** â€” A JavaScript runtime
-   ðŸ”µ **Express** â€” A web framework for Node Js
-   ðŸ’¹ **Nunjucks** â€” A powerful template engine for Node Js

## Getting started

First of all you'll need to install the NodeJs in your machine, if you are a Windows user I'd recommend to install via Chocolatey (If you're user of other OS search for the best way to install Nodejs in your case)

-   Use the steps given by the official web site: https://chocolatey.org/install

Then you'll need the framework Express for the server setup.

-   Use the following command on your terminal (VScode): npm install express

Then I'd recommend to use nodemon as a devDependencies, just for practicality.

-   Use the following command on your terminal: npm install nodemon -D

In this project it was used a template view engine, that in this case was Nunjucks.
So...

-   Use the following command on your terminal: npm install nunjucks -y
